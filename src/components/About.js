					<p>
						I am a Web Developer born and raised in the Silicon
						Valley and moved to the Portland area in 2005. I enjoy
						learning about new tech especially when it comes to
						consumer electronics (I love my Apple products) and also
						mining crypto. I was first introduced to Web Development
						in high school. We learned about HTML and created web
						pages in class.

						I'm a graduate of the PDX Code Guild 14-week Bootcamp.
						During the Bootcamp, we focused on being full stack
						Python-based web develoeprs. My current (and ever
						evolving knowledge) includes Python, Django, Django REST
						Framework, VueJS, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm
						currently learning ReactJS to add to my toolbelt.
